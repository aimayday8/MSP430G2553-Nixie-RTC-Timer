# MSP430G2553-Nixie-RTC-Timer
A rtc/timer developed with MSP430G2553 using the IN-12 Nixie Tube. It displays time by default, and can change to count down timer with button press. Can also display humidity and temperature. Automatic brightness adjustment with built in environmental light sensor.

Humidity and light sensor routines are not added in the main code but was written in the sensor driver file.

It's not well commentted for now and I'll add in detailed comments in a few days.

Feel free to use the code and ask for questions. My email: duliqiang8@gmail.com.
